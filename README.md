## CSC-380

CSC-380 should be a top down, “_Doodle-jump_” inspired 
platforming game. The player will have to jump from platform to platform, avoiding obstacles 
and hazards in a quest to obtain the highest score. The main character will be a 
SUNY Oswego Computer Science student trying to navigate through his college career. 

The obstacles he faces will include Due Dates, Student Loans, Lake Effect Weather, 
and anything else life in _SUNY Oswego_ throws at him. The Obstacles he faces will include:

 - **Due-Dates:** As the player progresses upwards, they will have to avoid “Due-Dates”. 
    These will take shape as rectangular blocks of paper which fall from the sky. 
    The player will have to navigate around these in order to succeed in his classes. 
    If the player comes in contact with a “Due-Date” the game is over.

 - **Student-Loans:** As the player progresses upwards, student loans will chase him 
    from below. They will take the shape of rectangular blocks of paper chasing him 
    upwards through game levels. The player will have to avoid these in order to 
    continue game progression. If the player comes in contact with a “Student Loan” 
    the game is over. 
    
 - **Lake Effect Weather:** Further into the game, the player will come across weather 
    hazard signs. These will indicate that a gust of wind will push the player to either 
    the left or right side of the screen. This can knock the player off his platform, 
    ending the game. 
    
 The goal of the game is to navigate upwards avoiding obstacles and accumulating points 
 adding to your overall High-Score. The higher the player gets, and the more points he gathers, 
 the harder gameplay will become. This entails increased speed of gameplay, faster moving obstacles,
  and more hazards for the player to avoid.
